# Global World Population Reports

## Description

This coursework forms part of the SET09803 DevOps module at Edinburgh Napier University.
Working as a Scrum team, we were tasked with designing and implementing a population reporting system
using an SQL database, Java, and DevOps practices such as GitFlow branching, continuous integration with GitHub Actions, Docker deployment, and automated testing.
